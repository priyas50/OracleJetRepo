# OracleJetRepo
Repository for the Oracle Jet Code snippets
Created a sample project to demonstrate the Wizard functionality using Oracle Jet.
We basically require the Oracle Jet libraries mentioned in the main.js file. 
Import the EmployeeWizard project in the NetBeans or JDeveloper.
Add a folder with all the required libraries.
Modify the relative path mentioned in the main.js and the employeeWizard.html accordingly.
Note: If the paths are incorrect, then "require.js missing" exception would be thrown.
Please check all the relative paths mentioned in all the files are redirecting to the correct path.
After setting all the paths correctly, run the employeeWizard.html directly using RunFile option in NetBeans IDE.
Check the results in the Browser.
I have also attached a document "Wizard Screens.docx" with all the screenshots of each step in the wizard
